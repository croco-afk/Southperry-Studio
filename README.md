### Souhtperry Studio

Update (2026.1.1):

New Features: Added custom room rules GUI (character & skill factor adjustments), map parsing support, and an in-app game database viewer.

Status: The project now functions like a "Workshop" model.

Note: Due to shared components with the web version, I’ll be decoupling the code before updating the open-source repository.

Download: The latest .exe is available in the "Releases" (or "sidebar") page.



This is a tool designed to preview and extract skill animations from Maplestory Wz files. It is primarily intended for "Southperry" players to acquire assets for creating custom skills.
